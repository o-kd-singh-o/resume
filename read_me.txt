All the files in my system work perfectly fine and also I've validated them with W3 Validator.
Please let me know if things don't work on your laptop/pc for any reason - email - kundande@ualberta.ca

Open main file - "index.html" as display page linked to other pages (resume and about me). 
You can also directly open other files, cross linking has been done in them as well. 

Thanks!
